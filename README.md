# Encrypted Diary - Python
Project for the 4th Semester Sub -> Open Source Lab Technology

Encrypted	Diary	is	a	fututrproof	data/ﬁle encryptor	and	decryptor created	in	python.

- Enter your data in textbox
- Just	with	a	click	of	a	button	encrypt/decrypt	your	data
- Magic :3

## Features
- Generate	a	base64	encoded	key,and	directly	save	it	in	a	txt	ﬁle.
- Using	the	unique	key	ﬁle	type	and	encrypt	your	data	in	a ‘.encrypted’	ﬁle,export	it	directly	to	the	program	directory.
- Decryption	of	the	‘.encrypted’	ﬁle	will	be	done	if	and	only	if	the same	base64	encoded	key	ﬁle	which	was	used	to	encrypt	the data	is	present	in	the	directory.The	key	is	thus	unique. 
- Erase	all	the	traces	of	your	data	and	all	the	encrypted/decrypted ﬁles	in	a	single	click	of	a	button.

_Encrypted	Diary	is	a	simple	but	a	powerful	tool	to	secure	your	data	form outsider	uses._

## Aim
